## Back to the future (250)

### Description

Our intelligence suggests that the DeLorean we previously recovered is capable of time travel.
According to the documents in our possession the time travel functionality is activated as soon as a specific ECU within the vehicle maintains a velocity of exactly 88 miles per hour for at least a few seconds. We rely on your CAN bus expertise to trick the time-travel ECU into thinking it is travelling at the right speed; again, the vehicle dashboard we restored should be of use.

Best of luck.

The Dashboard app is available here.
